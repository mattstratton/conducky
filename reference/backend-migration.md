# Backend TypeScript Migration Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of migrating the Conducky backend from JavaScript to TypeScript.

## Migration Strategy
**Approach**: Incremental route migration (changed from monolithic migration due to type complexity)

**Rationale**: The original approach of migrating the entire 3,547-line `index.js` file to TypeScript at once created overwhelming type conflicts between Express, Passport, Prisma, and custom middleware. The incremental approach allows us to:
1. Get a working TypeScript foundation
2. Add routes gradually with proper typing
3. Maintain test coverage throughout the process
4. Avoid complex type interaction issues

## Current Status: 🚀 PHASE 3 IN PROGRESS - Event Management Routes

**Test Progress**: 90/156 tests passing (57.7% success rate, up from 35%)
**Test Suites**: 6 passing, 4 failed (10 total)

### ✅ **COMPLETED PHASES**

#### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure ✅
- TypeScript compilation working (0 errors)
- Docker environment stable
- Database integration with Prisma
- Session management and middleware
- Basic route structure established

#### Phase 2: Core Authentication System ✅
- User registration with validation
- Login/logout functionality  
- Password reset workflow (forgot/reset/validate)
- Email availability checking
- Session management with user roles
- Rate limiting and security features

#### Phase 3: Event Management Routes 🚀 IN PROGRESS
**Progress**: Major routes implemented, 57.7% overall test success

**✅ Implemented Routes**:
- `POST /events` - Event creation (SuperAdmin only)
- `GET /events` - List all events (SuperAdmin only)
- `GET /events/:eventId` - Get event details
- `POST /events/:eventId/roles` - Assign user roles
- `DELETE /events/:eventId/roles` - Remove user roles
- `GET /events/:eventId/users` - List event users and roles
- `POST /events/:eventId/reports` - Create reports (with file upload)
- `GET /events/:eventId/reports` - List event reports
- `GET /events/:eventId/reports/:reportId` - Get specific report
- `PATCH /events/:eventId/reports/:reportId/state` - Update report state
- `PATCH /events/:eventId/reports/:reportId/title` - Edit report title
- `GET /events/slug/:slug/users` - List users by event slug
- `GET /events/slug/:slug/reports/:reportId` - Get report by slug
- `PATCH /events/slug/:slug` - Update event metadata

**🔄 Still Missing**:
- User avatar management (`/users/:userId/avatar`)
- Evidence file management (`/reports/:reportId/evidence`)
- Additional slug-based user management routes
- Event logo upload routes
- Invite management routes

## Migration Metrics

### 📈 **Progress Tracking**
- **Start**: 0% (JavaScript only)
- **Phase 1 Complete**: 21% (33/156 tests)
- **Phase 2 Complete**: 35% (55/156 tests)  
- **Phase 3 Current**: 57.7% (90/156 tests) 🚀

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Type Complexity**: Complex Express/Passport/Prisma type interactions
   - **Mitigation**: ✅ RESOLVED - Use pragmatic typing, refine incrementally
2. **Test Coverage Loss**: Risk of breaking functionality during migration
   - **Mitigation**: ✅ WORKING - Incremental migration with continuous testing
3. **Performance Regression**: TypeScript compilation overhead
   - **Mitigation**: Monitor response times, optimize if needed

### Rollback Plan
- Original `index.js` remains functional
- Can switch back by updating package.json scripts
- Database schema unchanged, no data migration needed

## Current Development Issues

### User Environment Setup Issues
The user is experiencing some local development setup issues:
1. **Missing dependencies**: `tsc` command not found, `nodemon` command not found
2. **Module resolution**: Express module not found in root directory
3. **Script availability**: Some npm scripts not available in root package.json

**Recommendation**: Use Docker Compose for development as intended:
```bash
# From project root
docker-compose up backend
```

This avoids local Node.js/npm version conflicts and ensures consistent environment.
