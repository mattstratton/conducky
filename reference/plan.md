- [X] Dashboard as currently implemented is not appropriate, we should remove the dashboard and have a page for each event that shows the reports for that event

- [ ] At limits for file uploads ([#31](https://github.com/mattstratton/conducky/issues/31))
- [ ] Make sure there is a public path to the code of conduct of the event ([#28](https://github.com/mattstratton/conducky/issues/28))

## Phase 5: Notifications

- [ ] Integrate flexible transactional email service (supporting multiple providers)
- [ ] Document setup for each supported email provider (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun, SMTP, etc.)
- [ ] Notify submitters on report submission, acknowledgment, resolution, and updates
- [ ] Notify responders/admins on new/updated reports

- [X] Implement authentication UI (login/logout)
- [X] Add dashboard page to list reports for an event
- [X] Add report submission form (type, description, evidence upload)
- [X] Add state change controls for authorized users (Responders/Admins)
- [ ] Event page needs to list who the admins and responders are for that event ([#10](https://github.com/mattstratton/conducky/issues/10))

- [ ] Make sure the UI is responsive and works on mobile devices (IN PROGRESS)
  - [X] Audit and update all major pages for mobile (login, home, dashboard, event, admin, user management, report detail)
  - [X] Audit and update all shared components (Card, Table, Button, Input) for mobile
  - [X] Make tables horizontally scrollable on small screens if needed
  - [X] Ensure forms and buttons are touch-friendly
  - [ ] Adjust font sizes and spacing for readability
  - [X] Make modals and overlays usable on mobile
  - [ ] Test navigation and all actions on mobile
- [ ] Ensure we are using best practices for accessibility (aria-labels, focus management, keyboard navigation, etc.) (to be done later)
- [ ] Ensure a delightful mobile experience ([#13](https://github.com/mattstratton/conducky/issues/13))

## UI/UX Responsive Design Standards (for all new pages)

- Use **Card layout** for lists and data on mobile (below `sm:`), and **Table layout** for desktop (`sm:` and up) for data-heavy views.
- All Card containers should use responsive padding: `p-4 sm:p-8`.
- All buttons and inputs should use responsive sizing: `px-4 py-2 sm:px-3 sm:py-1.5 sm:text-sm` for comfortable touch targets on mobile and compactness on desktop.
- Ensure all forms, tables, and actions are touch-friendly and readable on mobile (adequate spacing, font size, and tap targets).
- Make tables horizontally scrollable on small screens if needed.
- When adding new pages or layouts, always audit for these standards to ensure a consistent, modern, and accessible experience across devices.

## Event Metadata Display & UX Improvements

- [X] Display event metadata at the top of the event page (logo, name, dates, website, description, code of conduct link)
- [X] Render logo as an image if present
- [X] Show 'View Code of Conduct' link that opens a modal with rendered markdown
- [X] If user is Admin or SuperAdmin, show pencil icons for inline editing of each field
- [X] Allow inline editing and PATCH updates for all fields on the event page
- [ ] Extract shared component for metadata display/edit if needed
- [X] Ensure layout is responsive and accessible
- [X] Update documentation in /docs to reflect new metadata editing features

## Suggested Next Task

- [X] Enhance the report submission form
  - [X] Add a date and time of incident field
  - [X] Add a field for parties involved
  - [X] Update backend and frontend to support new fields
  - [X] Update docs for report submission changes

## Other/Architecture

- [ ] Consider adding support for "orgs" ([#18](https://github.com/mattstratton/conducky/issues/18))
- [ ] Remove Superadmin access to reports etc ([#17](https://github.com/mattstratton/conducky/issues/17))
- [ ] Remove event constraint ([#16](https://github.com/mattstratton/conducky/issues/16))
- [ ] Should event slugs be editable? ([#15](https://github.com/mattstratton/conducky/issues/15))
- [ ] Figure out what happens if the superadmin also needs to be a user for an event ([#14](https://github.com/mattstratton/conducky/issues/14))
- [ ] Investigate anonymous reporting ([#12](https://github.com/mattstratton/conducky/issues/12))

## Report Comments - Completed

- [x] Slug-based comment endpoints implemented in backend
- [x] Edit and delete permissions enforced in backend (author can edit/delete, admin can delete)
- [x] Internal/external (visibility) comment logic enforced in backend and frontend
- [x] Frontend UI for editing and deleting comments (inline, with confirmation)

## Planned Features for Report Comments

- [ ] If a comment has been edited, it should be marked so users know it was edited.
- [ ] All edits or deletions of comments should be stored in the audit log (pending audit log implementation).

## Future Refactors & Technical Debt

- [ ] Refactor report detail pages (reporter and admin/responder) to use shared components for report metadata, evidence, and comments. Minimize code duplication and use role-based conditional rendering where possible, while keeping security and clarity. (Add after initial admin/responder UI is complete)

**Notes:**

- Local development will be done using Docker and docker-compose, running all services locally in containers for consistency and ease of onboarding.
- **When installing new npm packages or running dev commands, always use Docker Compose (e.g., `docker compose exec frontend npm install <package>`) to ensure the container environment is up to date. Do not run npm install directly on the host.**
- Be sure to remember that we always want to optimize for mobile experience
- We also want to make sure that everything is styled properly for dark mode
- Each phase can be broken down further as needed.
- We will iterate and adjust the plan as requirements evolve or new needs are discovered.
- Documentation will cover both system usage and all aspects of setup, configuration, local development, and hosting. 
- Documentation should be written in markdown and stored in the docs directory
- Documentation should be separated into user and developer documentation
